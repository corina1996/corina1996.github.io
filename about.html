			   <h1> <font color="black" face="Andalus"> This is a story of my life </h1>
			   <p style="column"> Hey there! I was born in 1996 in country colled Moldova, city Chisinau. I grew up in a big family with four siblings. My family consists of my parents, two older sisters and a younger brother. My siblings are amazing, we are pretty close and we always have fun together. When studying at LCC I mis them lots, and I wish I could home every break, but unfortunately I do not. I am a fourth year students at LCC, and I study Conteporary Communication. I admit that i chose my major, simply becuause i did not like any othe–∫ option, however I ended up really liking it. I enjoy learning about different media and learning about how human relationship work in general. I have realized that sometimes we take many things as common sense however, knowing and acknowledging some concepts that exist and work all around the world. Well this is a short story of me, and I hope you enjoyed reading it. :) </p>
